# Belly-Button-Challenge
## Description:
In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Dashboard:
A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

A bubble chart that displays each sample.

Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

A Gauge Chart that updates whenever a new sample is selected.
